# VANAVIL APP

Vanavil App is aimed to provide customers with a car-wash progress page (indicated time estimated and stage of car wash), a catalog page (displaying the products offered in Vanavil), and Rewards/Histroy page (shows the number of visits and rewards available to claim). It should have the ability to also push notifications if there's any offers or deals provided.
